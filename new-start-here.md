The easiest way to find something that you'll be interested in is to [look at
the archives][10] and browse the titles, which (I hope) are descriptive. Using
the built-in Google site search there would also be useful.


I also write a lot about other technical areas, and am attempting to write up
more about my thoughts on various technical research papers. 

**Generic Technical Guides**, not including those related to my prelims study:

- [Basics of Bayesian Neural Networks][55]


Notes on **Specific Research Papers** (for others, see [this GitHub repository][60]):


- [Learning to Act by Predicting the Future][57]
- [Some Recent Results on Minibatch Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods][25]


Finally, I write sometimes about **the books I read**, such as in the following:

- [All the Books I Read in 2017, Plus My Thoughts][61]
- [All the Books I Read in 2016, Plus My Thoughts][26]
- [Thoughts on How to Win Friends and Influence People][54]
- [Alan Turing: The Enigma][51]
